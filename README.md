# Information Sharing in Seaweed Farming: Investigating the Dynamics of Participation in Facebook Groups Among Indonesian Seaweed Farmers

Data science project to analyze themes in seaweed farming Facebook posts over time to understand issues farmers face for better policy making &amp; the potential for digital technology usage in aquacultural extension services. Created in part for my honors thesis project and in part for the final DATASCI112 project at Stanford University.

## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

Different features include:
- date
- month
- average temperature
- precipitation (prcp)
- air pressure

"""
 (NEXT TIME TO DO A GUIDED LDA)
To guide an LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) model to include certain words in different topics,
you can use a semi-supervised approach known as "seeded" or "guided" LDA. This involves incorporating
seed words or a dictionary of seed words for each topic, which influences the topic-word distributions.

One method to achieve this is to use the GuidedLDA library, which allows you to incorporate prior
knowledge into the LDA model. You can specify seed words for each topic, and the model will give higher
probability to these words in the respective topics.

## Needs of this project

- frontend developers
- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
- etc. (be as specific as possible)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repo (for help see this [tutorial](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/)).
2. Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    *If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)*
    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)

## Data Source

The source of the Facebook posts is from Madeline Grist's thesis, *Propagule Distribution Systems of Tropical Carrageenan Seaweed in South Sulawesi: Value Chain and Social Media Analyses* and while the dataset is not publicly available, the Facebook group from which the posts were gleaned is a public Facebook group, the Rumput Laut Centre. 

The weather data is available [here](https://meteostat.net/en/place/id/makassar?s=97180&t=2022-08-04/2022-09-01).
